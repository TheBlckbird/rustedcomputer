# Rusted Computer (WIP)

A Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers to interact with the world.
It runs WASM and therefore supports any programming language that can target WebAssembly.

The main target (for now) is Rust, but it is planned to provide libraries for other programming languages.

## WIP

Please note that this is still work in progress and not yet usable.
